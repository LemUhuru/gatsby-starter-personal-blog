Welcome to my world, i.e, my inner thoughts on a range of social and technological issues and perhaps, ocassionally, an introduction into my physical reality. I'll write in-depth on matters of sociology, ideaology, psychology, religion, economics, identity, and intelligence. I have a lot to say, and you may find some of it offensive, if that is the case, don't take it personal, my opinion is one in a sea of 7.6 [billion][1] as of 10/2018 : ).
