Let it out! Not you, me! Ok, no need for exclamation marks, you get the point. I'm yelling at myself because my mind is filled with ideas, thoughts, and emotions. And like the image above, I need to release them but it's not always clear as to what the best medium or format to express oneself is. 

You see, I can be a very selfish person. In fact, my purpose for blogging is not entirely to express myself to the world; but to talk to myself, albeit, more formally than usual. I'd also like to come back and see a record of the conversations with myself from anywhere. Yeah. I want to monitor the relationship with myself as well, is it progressing? Am I progressing? What does progression look like?

The greatest benefit of blogging lies in the act of self communication. If you think about it, all communication is self communication, as you can't communicate to someone else without hearing your own words; reading your own writings, observing your own body language. Communication is inherently recursive. It should then make sense why blogging or keeping a written journal is especially beneficial and soothing for the mind. It eliminates external participants and reduces the conversation to a single feedback loop, you, and the self.

There is also a beauty in the creative process, it results from the time and effort placed into word selection and organizing the ideal formation of your ideas into a coherent structure that conveys with precision how you feel and think. If we seek to progress at communication then we must eliminate noise and filter from our writings. Contrastly, what if one mans filter is anothers context? Is their merit to a more verbose style of writing? Even redundancy? 

Admittedly, it's difficult to communicate with precision when the representations of the mind don't convert directly to natural language. So if the initial translation from mind to paper is difficult, how much harder for the reader to interpret the exact meaning as the author intended it. As a writer you're competing against a myriad of cultural influences and sub-cultural nuances that affect how people will associate and interpret your words. It's mind boggling how we as human beings ever achieve any form of synchronization. 


In fact, maybe we never achieve syncronization, and understand just enough to "get the idea". The rewards of self expression through introspection are grand, and at the core of all communication is recursive communication or self communication. There is a beauty and craftmanship to producing quality writings that capture the essence of self expression with precision. As a result I'll track my progress and development with each piece by asking the following questions:
* How can I convey succintly and with precision my ideas? 
* How can I measure and test whether my writings sync with my target audience?
